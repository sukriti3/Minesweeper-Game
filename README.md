MINESWEEEPER GAME

Minesweeper is a puzzle game that features a grid of clickable squares, with hidden mines scattered throughout the board. The objective of the game is to clear the board without detonating any mines. Players are given clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field, allowing them to deduce which squares are safe to click.

This implementation of Minesweeper uses the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the game. Tkinter is a standard Python module that requires no additional installation. It provides buttons for each square on the grid, allowing users to interact with the game visually. When a player clicks on a square, it either reveals a number indicating the nearby mines or triggers a mine, ending the game. The GUI makes the game more engaging and user-friendly by providing a visual representation of the board and making it easier to interact with compared to a command-line interface.

With this version, you can enjoy the classic Minesweeper experience while exploring the power of Python's GUI capabilities using Tkinter. The project code is hosted in a GitHub repository, where you can review, customize, and contribute to the game.
